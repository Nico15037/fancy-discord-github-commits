------------------------------
the workflow file in the repo:

-----
in your repo's root folder:
make a ".github" folder in your repo's root
make a "workflows" folder
now in ".github/workflows", make "discord-webhook.yml"

-----
now edit "discord-webhook.yml":

uses https://github.com/Sniddl/discord-commits

make sure the on: push: is set to the right branch (master/main/whatever it is)

now for the actual part of it
- name: Discord Commits
        uses: Sniddl/discord-commits@v1.6
        with:
          webhook: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK }}
          embed: '{}'

"webhook:" uses the github repo's secret that has your discord webhook in it (we'll get to that later)
"embed:" is the embed. it'll go inside the '{}', and make sure you have the '' around the {} or it won't work



------------------------------
for making the embed:

https://discohook.org (has a live preview)
when you've made it, go to JSON data editor (at the bottom) and copy the "embeds" section
and make sure to remove the "[]" it's enclosed in

here's an example of what you should have
    {
      "title": "oh shit",
      "description": "fuck",
      "color": 15105570
    }

"wtf is that color code format" discord uses ANSI color codes because they hate us

anyways you can run it through https://jsonlint.com if you want to prettify it

-----
customize the embed based on the commit (the cool part):

gamers I gotta be real I don't know where to find a list of these
I literally brute forced it and made the embed print the entire payload with all variables so I could find what I want
and that was I think years ago by now so I can't find where I dumped it or even remember how to do it
I think you just make the desc {{ commit }} {{ github.context.payload }}? but .slice it or something bc it's fucking MASSIVE

ANYWAYS HERE'S AN EXAMPLE
    {
      "title": "{{ commit.title }}",
      "description": "{{ commit.author.username }} pushed this at {{ commit.timestamp }}. check out the {{ commit.description }}",
      "color": 15105570
    }

and a list of the ones I know
commit.title
commit.description
commit.url
commit.author.username
commit.timestamp
again, try just putting {{ commit }} to see what you want
and {{ commit.author }} for the author variables

------------------------------
in github:
go to the repo -> settings ->



dude this shit isn't working
make sure there are no tabs, only spaces
