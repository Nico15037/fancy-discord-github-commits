the workflow file in the repo:
uses https://github.com/Sniddl/discord-commits

make sure the on: push: is set to the right branch (master/main/whatever it is)

now for the actual part of it
- name: Discord Commits
        uses: Sniddl/discord-commits@v1.6
        with:
          webhook: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK }}
          embed: '{}'

"webhook:" uses the github repo's secret that has your discord webhook in it (we'll get to that later)
"embed:" is the embed. make sure it has the '' around the {}.

for making the embed: https://discohook.org (has a live preview)
when you've made it go to JSON data editor (at the bottom) and copy the "embeds" section - make sure to remove the "[]" it's enclosed in
you can run it through https://jsonlint.com/ if you want to prettify it





in github:
go to the repo -> settings ->



dude this shit isn't working
make sure there are no tabs, only spaces
