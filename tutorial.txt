3 parts - workflow file, the github website, and making the embed 

------------------------------
THE WORKFLOW FILE (in the repo):

    -----
    in your repo's root folder:
        make a ".github" folder in your repo's root
        make a "workflows" folder
        now in ".github/workflows", make "discord-webhook.yml"

    -----
    editing "discord-webhook.yml":

        this uses https://github.com/Sniddl/discord-commits
        v3 because any past that make it say "Successful Commit to" BRO SHUT UP GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE

        make sure the on: push: is set to the right branch (master/main/whatever it is)
        it'll be at the top of the file looking something like this:
        on:
          push:
            branches: [ main ]

        now for the actual part of it
        - name: Discord Commits
          uses: Sniddl/discord-commits@v1.3
          with:
            webhook: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK }}
            embed: '{}'

        "webhook:" uses the github repo's secret that has your discord webhook in it (we'll get to that later)
        "embed:" is the embed. it'll go inside the '{}', and make sure you have the '' around the {} or it won't work

tl;dr just copy paste this and throw in your embed
-----

name: Discord Webhook Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  postcommitmessage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Discord Commits
        uses: Sniddl/discord-commits@v1.3
        with:
          webhook: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK }}
          embed: '{
            "title": "{{ commit.title }}",
            "description": "{{ commit.description }}",
            "color": 10062971
            }'

-----

------------------------------
MAKING THE EMBED:

https://discohook.org (has a live preview)
when you've made it, go to JSON data editor (at the bottom) and copy the "embeds" section
and make sure to remove the "[]" it's enclosed in

here's an example of what you should have
    {
      "title": "oh shit",
      "description": "fuck",
      "color": 15105570
    }

"wtf is that color code format" discord uses ANSI color codes because they hate us

anyways you can run it through https://jsonlint.com if you want to prettify it

-----
customize the embed based on the commit (the cool part):

gamers I gotta be real I don't know where to find a list of these
I literally brute forced it and made the embed print the entire payload with all variables so I could find what I want
and that was I think years ago by now so I can't find where I dumped it or even remember how to do it
I think you just make the desc {{ commit }} {{ github.context.payload }}? but .slice it or something bc it's fucking MASSIVE
future nico: OK I JUST TRIED AND IDK HOW I DID IT. GOOD LUCK GUYS.

ANYWAYS HERE'S AN EXAMPLE
    {
      "title": "{{ commit.title }}",
      "description": "{{ commit.author.username }} pushed this at {{ commit.timestamp }}. check out the {{ commit.description }}",
      "color": 15105570
    }

and a list of the ones I know
commit.title
commit.description
commit.url
commit.author.username
commit.timestamp
again, try just putting {{ commit }} in the description part of the embed to see what you want
and {{ commit.author }} for the author variables

unfortunately idk how to change the webhook's icon (what looks like the message "sender") to something custom
I think you'd have to mess with the actual github action's code (https://github.com/Sniddl/discord-commits)



------------------------------
THE GITHUB WEBSITE:

go to the repo -> settings -> secrets and variables -> actions
click "new repository secret"
for the name "DISCORD_WEBHOOK"
for the secret, paste in your webhook

yeah that's it


------------------------------
DUDE THIS SHIT ISN'T WORKING:

make sure there are no tabs, only spaces
check your embed in jsonlint.com
make sure you made the webhook in your discord server

or just suffer and restart this tutorial
